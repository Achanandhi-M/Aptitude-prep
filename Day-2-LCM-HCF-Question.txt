2. What is the Sum of LCM and HCF of 5/18, 35/9 and 15/63?

a) 1475/252
b) 1475/126
c) 625/252
d) 625/126


Answer b) 1475/126

Explanation

Formula

LCM Of Fractions=LCM of Numerator/ HCF of denominator = LCM(15,35,5)/HCF(18,9,63)=105/9

HCF of Fractions= HCF of denominator/ LCM of Numerator=HCF(5,35,15)/LCM(18,9,63)=5/126

Final Answer= 105/9 + 5/126
Final Answer = 1475/126
